This repository contains implementations of Finite Integration Techniques based on the paper [A discretization model for the solution of Maxwell's equations for six-component fields](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977ArElU..31..116W/abstract) by T. Weiland, aimed at simulating electromagnetic field problems.

## Overview

Electromagnetic field simulation is crucial for various engineering applications, and Finite Integration Techniques (FIT) offer an effective approach to solving Maxwell's equations in complex geometries. This repository presents implementations of FIT methods and their applications to solve electromagnetic field problems and is organized into seven tasks, each addressing different aspects of electromagnetic field simulation:

### Task 1: Eigenvalue Solver and Convergence Study
- Discretization of 3D objects
- Convergence study of eigenvalue solver

### Task 2: Mesh Creation and Geometric Matrices
- Creation of meshes
- Generation of geometric and topological matrices
- Imprinting field distributions

### Task 3: Material Matrices and Boundary Conditions
- Implementation of material matrices
- Application of boundary conditions
- Interpolation of fields

...

Detailed descriptions of each task and their outcomes can be found in the [report](https://github.com/paulffm/Methods-and-Applications-of-Electromagnetic-Field-Simulation-using-FIT/blob/main/Protokollheft.pdf).

## Visualization
